        <p>STYLISHWEAR, a newly launched online clothing website, knows the fashion industry can be a dirty place, 
        thereby supporting eco-friendly standards. The brand wants the customers to look and feel as clean as 
        possible with its high-quality apparel for both men and women including hoodies & sweatshirts, dresses, 
        trousers and the comfiest tees among others. The clothes are made from organic and sustainably grown cotton, 
        biodegradable modal and alpaca fibre and they are all crafted from non-toxic dyes. So, the categories of 
        clothes are A+ quality, hence, our customers may not necessarily wash their clothes after one wear.</p>
